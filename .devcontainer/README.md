```markdown
# 🧠 NemHem AI – Unified AI Interface for Scira & DeepSeek

## 📌 Overview

This project is part of an **Intern Interview Assessment Assignment** to develop a lightweight, web-based AI interface that integrates **Scira** and **DeepSeek** APIs. The interface allows seamless interaction with both models and supports **automatic chaining** of model outputs to create a streamlined multi-model AI chat experience—drawing inspiration from the design simplicity of **Mysore AI**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build a user-friendly, modular system where:
- Scira and DeepSeek APIs are fully integrated.
- Chaining logic allows output of one model to feed into the next.
- The UI is intuitive and clean for a smooth user experience.
- The project is deployed either locally or on a lightweight cloud platform (Render/Vercel).

## 📦 Tech Stack

| Layer        | Tools/Frameworks                   |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| Frontend     | Streamlit (Python-based lightweight UI) |
| Backend      | Python (Streamlit + REST API requests)  |
| Deployment   | Localhost or lightweight cloud (Vercel/Render) |
| Versioning   | GitHub                             |

---

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ **Scira and DeepSeek API Integration**
- 🔁 **Chaining Logic**: Automatic transfer of outputs between models
- 🤖 **Model Selector**: Choose one or multiple models (Scira, DeepSeek)
- 💬 **Interactive Chat UI**: Input, responses, and conversation history
- 🌐 **Streamlit Web App**: Lightweight, responsive frontend
- 🔐 **Environment Configuration**: Secure API key management using `.env`

## 📄 .env Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_together_api_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEYS=key1,key2,key3
````

## 🚀 Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nemhem-ai-chat.git
cd nemhem-ai-chat
```

### 2. Create virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the application

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## 🧪 Functionality

### 🔁 Chaining Mode

* Enables users to select multiple LLMs (e.g., Scira → DeepSeek).
* Output from the first model is sent as input to the second automatically.

### 🤖 Single Model Mode

* Lets user choose a single model to interact with directly.

### 💡 Model Options

* Gemini
* Scira (via Together API)
* DeepSeek
* Mistral
* OpenRouter (Moonshot, Qwen, etc.)

---

## 🖼️ User Interface

The UI is designed with:

* Minimal configuration in the sidebar (toggle chain mode, model selection)
* Streamlit’s `st.chat_message()` and `st.chat_input()` for real-time chatting
* Loading spinners, response code display, and error handling

---

## 🔁 Chaining Logic (Backend)

Implemented chaining mechanism:

* Takes initial user prompt
* Iterates over selected models in sequence
* Feeds output from one as input to the next
* Displays all intermediate results in order

Modular function: `call_llm(prompt, model_label)` abstracts the logic for any model and can be extended easily for future integrations.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Debugging

* API error codes are captured (401, 403, 429) and handled gracefully.
* Each model call is wrapped in `try-except`.
* Response latency and model errors are indicated in the UI.

---

## 🌐 Deployment

You can deploy this application on:

* **Render**: Add a `render.yaml` and deploy via GitHub.
* **Vercel** (for frontend + FastAPI combo if used)
* **Localhost**: Using `streamlit run main.py`

---
